        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>My name is Kicki and I've been working as a preeschool-teacher for the last ten years.
        <br>I live in Eskilstuna, Sweden, with my husband <b>Martin</b> and my three children <b>Ebba</b>, <b>Lukas</b> and <b>Ronja</b>. 
        <br>I love to do jigsawpuzzles, crosswords and to take a walk in nature for relaxing.</p>

        <h3>In the future</h3>
        <p>I've just started out an education named <b>IT: TECH FOR WOMEN</b> at Sundsgårdens folkhögskola and hope that this will lead to a new career in frontend or webdevelopment in the future (perhaps they are the same?). 
        <br>I'm very much a newbe at html, css and JS, but I'm really looking forward to learn more! 
        </p>

        <h3>Other things</h3>
        <p>This is my first project in this course, and it's about making our first own webpage and conecting it to github. We'll see if I'll manage!
        <br>My native language is Swedish and I know my English wrighting is not perfect, but I will try and make my projects mostly in English anyway for training. 
        <br>Please let me know if you find any errors. Thank you!
